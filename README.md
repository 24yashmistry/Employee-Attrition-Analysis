# Employee Attrition Analysis Project

## Overview
This project aims to analyze employee attrition within XYZ Company to understand why employees are leaving the company and to reduce the attrition rate. The project involves the following steps:

1. Data Exploration and Cleaning
2. Attrition Analysis
3. Machine Learning Model Development for Attrition Prediction
4. Dashboard Development for Visualization and Insights

- EmployeeID
- Age
- Attrition
- BusinessTravel
- Department
- DistanceFromHome
- Education
- EducationField
- EmployeeCount

- YearsSinceLastPromotion
- YearsWithCurrManager
- EnvironmentSatisfaction
- JobSatisfaction
- WorkLifeBalance
- JobInvolvement
- PerformanceRating

## Analysis Steps

### 1. Data Exploration and Cleaning
- The dataset was explored to understand its structure and identify any missing or inconsistent data.
- Data cleaning steps were performed to handle missing values, duplicates, and ensure data consistency.

### 2. Attrition Analysis
- The dataset was analyzed to understand the reasons for employee attrition.
- Factors contributing to attrition were identified, including job satisfaction, work-life balance etc.

### 3. Machine Learning Model Development
- A machine learning model was developed to predict whether an employee will leave the company or not.
- Features such as Department, JobLevel, JobRole, MonthlyIncome, PercentSalaryHike, YearsAtCompany etc were used to train the model.
- Different classification algorithms were tested, and the best performing model was selected.

### 4. Dashboard Development
- A dashboard was created using Excel to visualize the findings from the analysis.
- The dashboard includes interactive visualizations to explore the data and gain insights into employee attrition.


## Conclusion
This project provides valuable insights into employee attrition within XYZ Company.
